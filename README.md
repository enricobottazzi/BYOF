# BYOG
BYOG (Bring your own gang) allows you to create a list of contacts from other ethereum address and bring it inside any compatible web3 protocol

Twitter, Discord and any centralized social media platform keep their social graphs closed. If Discord suddenly shuts down, all your Discord contacts are lost. If you want to leave Twitter you cannot bring your contacts with you.

Today there's nothing that gives the users ownership on their list of contracts and make it portable from platform to platform.

BYOG is the new web3 standard that unlocks ownership over your list of contracts (a.k.a. YOUR GANG).

Main components of BYOG: 

- Gang creation: once you connect your wallet to BYOG you can ask any ethereum address to be part of your gang. Each address will need to sign a message to confirm they want to be part of your gang 
- Encryption: your list of friend is encrypted directely with AES (to be implemented with Metamask) and uploaded to IPFS
- An NFT is generated that points to that encrypted list giving you 100% ownership over your gang
- When the user joins a decentralized social media or an NFT game, he/she can allow the platform to access their gang by decrypting the list and seamlessly start chatting or playing with their friends

BYOG gives: 
- **censorship resistant ownership upon your list of contacts**
- **portability and composability across web3 protocols**
- **privacy guaranteed by asymmetric cryptography**
