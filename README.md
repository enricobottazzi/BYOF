# BYOF
BYOF (bring your own friends) is a protocol that allows users to follow ethereum addresses ang get followed back. It can be installed as a plugin inside every web3 Dapp that relies on social networks.

Twitter, Discord and any centralized social media platform keep their social graphs closed. If Discord suddenly shuts down, all your Discord contacts are lost. If you want to leave Twitter you cannot bring your contacts with you.
Today there's nothing that gives the users ownership on their list of contracts and make it portable from platform to platform.

Visiting BYOF.com you can start following ethereum addresses and get followed. Once you are in Decentraland you can import your lists and start hanging around with your friends.  
If you meet someone cool in Decentraland you can start following them: they will always be part of your social graph, beyond Decentraland. 

BYOG unlocks: 
- **censorship resistant ownership** upon your list of followers
- **portability and composability** across web3 protocols
- **privacy** guaranteed by asymmetric cryptography
